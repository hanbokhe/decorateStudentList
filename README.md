# decorateStudentList
Write a function called decorateClassListWithAges. Convert from an array, in this case a class list of names, to an array of object literals decorated with a name and an age for each student. Your decorateClassListWithAges function should use the provided getRandomIntInclusive as part of its solution. (The ages should be randomly generated for each student, either age 10 or age 11)

The "test suite" that you write for this question will be one of the most complex we have seen so far. In order to verify that your code works as expected, you will need to find a way to iterate over the actual array result of your function, then ensure that the age value for each object in your result is "within the range" of 10 to 11. If you are having tremendous difficulty constructing your test suite, please feel free to consult the reference answers.

While you should create your own test suite to get the most out of this exercise, there are automated tests provided as well.
